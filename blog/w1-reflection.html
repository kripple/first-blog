      <h3 class="blog-title">Dev Bootcamp: Phase 1, Week 1</h3>

      <p>I'm not really sure what my blog format will be at this point. I know that I want to capture what the DBC experience is for me, and I want to blog about it. Below are my daily reflections.</p>
    </section>
      <h2>[ July 27, 9:03 PM ] What Have I Gotten Myself Into?</h2>

      <p>I kid! Today was great. We met all the staff, got to meet everyone face-to-face. I'm less intimidated by the process now that I've met the people behind it (probabaly becuase they work to mitigate the intimidation factor - at least I think that's what they're doing). We have these check-ins that last two minutes per person, whether or not that person has something to say or not. Not going to lie, the check-ins scare me the most at this juncture (I *hate* being the center of attention in this way). Sure, I'm worried that I won't be able to keep up, but I'm less afraid of that now that I've been here for a  day. I'm really excited to be here and I know that my enthusiasm will carry me through. I'm grateful to have found the thing that reignites my passion for creating things. Just last night I made this <a href="http://kellyripple.com/projects/hangman/hangman.html">kickass hangman game</a>. I'm so proud of it that I've been showing it to almost everyone I meet.</p>

      <h3>Stuff I Learned Today:</h3>

      <p><code>variable = args.fetch(:hash_key, default_value)</code> is way better than <code>variable = args[hash_key] || default_value</code>, mostly because the second option doesn't work all the time with boolean values (see pg. 48-49 of <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">POODR</a> for better explanation).</p>

      <p>What else did I learn today ... My cohort is awesome, and pairing is a skill. Sleep is really important, and having a good attitude is a much bigger part of being 'effective' than you might think (especially on account of the pairing). I very much look forward to getting to know my cohort-mates better. Once we're all reasonably used to each other, I think this experience is going to get a lot cooler.

      <p>Day One, signing out!</p>
